## Research Hobbies
**March 2022**

a.k.a "things I'm interested in, but not actively researching" include:
- HyperNetworks.
- VQVAEs.
- Meta-learning optimizers.
- Sparse experts models (and sparse models in general).
- Multi-Modal models.
- Computational humor.
- Hebrew NLP.


## Other Hobbies
- I really like Science Fiction media, I'm currently reading the Expanse series, and I take great interest in any space news, and anything related to SpaceX and the Starship program.
- In my free time I sometimes play video games, right now I'm playing Elden Ring on the PS5, but I mainly like RPGs, and single player narrative experience, but I also enjoy the occasional First Person Shooter, I also have a VR headset and I can recommend Beat Saber to anyone, it's great fun.
