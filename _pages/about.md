P.hD student. Researching Natural Language Processing at Tel Aviv University. I'm advised by the awesome [Jonathan Berant](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~joberant/).
My current research subjects/interests include: 
- Long Term Reasoning
- Large Language Models
- Open Domain Question Answering


In more broad terms, I find anything related to strong artifical intelligence fascinating, and I'm very intrested by how we can harness the way humans think to come up with better methods for AI/NLP.
